## Purpose

Simple Prompt Library is a simple prompt library that you can use to store, rate, categorize, and sort your AI prompts. 
It's style is very simple an easy to use. 

This simple one-page app is designed to be used completely offline on your own computer. 
You can put it on a server if you want. 

## Layout

Simple Prompt Library has a simple layout using cards for each prompt you save. 
Click on the  + New Prompt button on the top right of the page to add a new prompt. 
A modal will appear and show a few options:
* Category
* Rating (stars)
* A favorite heart
* Title Field
* Prompt field
* Buttons for Save, Delete, and Copy

## Use
After saving, your prompts will appear on the page in a card layout. The colors on the coards indicate the rating. A rating of 1 is red, a rating of 5 is green. The colors change depending on the rating you give. 
You also have a dropdown menu to sort between different categories. 
If you mark a prompt as a favorite, it will always appear at the top of the page. 

There is also a button on the top left of the page to toogle between light and dark modes. 

## Future plans

I plan to add a way to upload images along with your prompts, for stuff like image generators.
