## Purpose

PromptVault is a modern prompt library that you can use to store, rate, categorize, and sort your AI prompts or any text you want. 
It's style is modern and easy to use. 

PromptVault is designed to be used completely offline on your own computer. 
You can host it on your own server if you want. But, be careful, it is not secured in any way.

## Layout

PromptVault has a modern layout using cards for each prompt you save. 
Click on the Create Prompt tile on the top left to add a new prompt. 
A modal will appear and show you the following options for you to edit:
* Category
* Rating (stars)
* Favorite (heart)
* Title Field
* Prompt details
* Buttons for Save and Copy

## Use
After saving, your prompts will appear in a grid layout on the right side of the page. The colored dots on each card indicate the rating. A rating of 1 is red, a rating of 5 is green. The colors change depending on the rating you give.

When you hover over a card, you will see the star rating you gave and a small excerpt of your prompt.

You can sort your prompts by category using the dropdown menu in the sidebar. 
If you mark a prompt as a favorite, it will always move to the first position of the grid and a heart icon will appear next to the title.

I also added a button to toggle between light and dark modes, located on the bottom of the side bar. 

Click on the "YOUR NAME" text in the sidebar to edit your name.
